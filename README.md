This is a simulation project for wheel-leg bikebot crossing rugged terrain using Raisim
==========================
A model predictive control is designed for the leg assistive
actuation to take advantage of the leg-ground interaction force
and balance torque.

The following video shows the created simulation scenario in RaiSim.
