This is a simulation project for wheel-leg bikebot crossing rugged terrain using Raisim
==========================
#### Introduction
Bicycle robot has high-speed and high-energy efficiency on off-road terrains, but is unable to keep balance at low speed and run on uneven terrain.
So we design a wheel-leg hybrid bikebot control system to provide assistive torque to balance the bikebot at low speed or off-road terrain conditions.

A model predictive control is designed for the leg assistive
actuation to take advantage of the leg-ground interaction force
and balance torque.

The following video shows the created simulation scenario in RaiSim.
